# Practice using design software

There will be opportunities to design user interfaces throughout the course. Spend time today getting familiar with some design software, so when you have the urge to design you know where to start.

We recommend [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), as it's free and used widely in the industry. You can start by watching [How to design a simple website in Adobe Xd for beginners](https://youtu.be/jHBMjjLY0Dw) on YouTube (20mins), and then try designing a website or a small part of an interface.

Keep focusing on the progress check from Day 4, only continue if you have completed that checklist. Today's material is extra content that will give you a head start, rather than required.
