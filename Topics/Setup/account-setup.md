# Setup accounts

## Miro

Being a remote-first company, we need a whiteboard that we can use from anywhere. We use a tool called Miro for this,

Sign up for a [Miro](https://miro.com/) account using your `@developersinstitute.co.nz` Google Account. This will give you access to our digital whiteboards.

## Frontend Masters

You will need a Frontend Masters account from week 2. However it's good to sign up and have a look around before then, as there are other courses that might interest you.

1. Go to [Getting Started with JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/getting-started-javascript-v2/), and click the red _Get Free Access Now_ button
2. Create an account, using your `@developersinstitute.co.nz` email address

**Note:** You can get a 6 month free subscription to Frontend Masters from the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). We will use free courses as part of the course, but with a premium subscription you have access to hundreds of high quality classes.

## Loom

We share a lot of videos in Loom. Create a Loom account so you can leave comments and feedback on videos that we share.

- [Loom](https://www.loom.com) - create an account on Loom with your Developers Institute email address. Ensure you are logged in when you are watching videos.

## freeCodeCamp

We will be using freeCodeCamp to practice and learn a lot of our web development. Visit [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and sign up for an account by clicking the big yellow `Get Started` button. Create an account and sign-in. Once you are signed-in, update your [profile settings](https://www.freecodecamp.org/settings) so the instructors can see your progress. You will need to switch on the following settings from `Private` to `Public`:

- My profile
- My points
- My heat map
- My certification
- My time line

You can also update the `Username` to something more memorable than the [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) placeholder.
