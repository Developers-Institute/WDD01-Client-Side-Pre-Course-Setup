# Customise VS Code

## Launching Visual Studio Code from the command line

You can also run VS Code from the terminal by typing 'code' after adding it to the path:

- Launch VS Code.
- Open the Command Palette (cmd + shift + p) and type `shell command` to find the Shell Command: `Install 'code' command in PATH` command.

  ![shell command](../../img/shell-command.png)

- Restart the terminal for the new \$PATH value to take effect. You'll be able to type 'code .' in any folder to start editing files in that folder.
