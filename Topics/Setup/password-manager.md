# Password management

As a future web developer security needs to always be in the front of your mind. Not just when developing websites but, also while managing your own online security.

`Password managers` are one of our frontline security tools. Password managers store your login information for all the websites you use and help you log into them automatically. They encrypt your password database with a master password (the master password is the only one you have to remember).It also generates them for you, so that each website has a strong unique password. You only have to remember your master password

Please check all the email addresses you use with a website called [Have I Been PWNED](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see if any of your online accounts associated with your emails accounts have been compromised.
If you have been using the internet for some time, there is an unfortunately high chance the password has been compromised.

If your email is compromised, you need to fix that by:

1. Resetting your passwords (unless you already have since the breach date). Any account where you used the same password is potentially compromised.
1. Stop using the same 3 passwords for everything
   - How... Sticky notes? Add a number on the end? No ðŸ¤¦ ! Time to use a password manager ðŸ˜Ž ...
1. Use a password manager to generate and remember all your passwords
   - Choose a good master password. Consider a phrase instead of a word. Don't use an old compromised password for this. Don't make it too hard to remember, as forgetting would be a disaster.
   - Us instructors, use [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) and [1Password](https://1password.com/) and other staff use [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/). 
   - All three options are plenty secure. KeePassXC is the most secure option, but unfortunately it's not hosted online (passwords saved to your disk, encrypted with your master password)
   - LastPass and Dashlane store passwords on their online server, encrypted with your master password. This allows them to be easily used between multiple computers.
   - You can get a free 6 month subscription to Dashlane as part of your [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
