# Install software

Watch [Introduction to VS Code, the command line, and GitHub](https://www.loom.com/share/9c662808140e4b8893f7e0424847f6b1) for an overview of some of the tools we will be installing to complete our web development

### Version Control

Git is an industry-standard tool for tracking changes to files, and allowing developers to collaborate on code together. It's like a shared Google Doc for code. We will be using it every day.

[Install git by visiting the git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads), downloading and installing the git application. 

If you are on a mac, watch [Installing applications on your Mac](https://www.loom.com/share/1325f420d7aa4871ac5fba2e721b4422?from_recorder=1) if you need help installing this software.

### Web-browser

Install a modern web browser, preferably [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html), [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), or [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/).

We like to use modern web browsers because they have excellent developer tools built in, which make your life as a developer much easier.

- Set your new browser as the default browser for your computer: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/make-firefox-your-default-browser), or [Brave Browser](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020406572-How-do-I-set-Brave-to-be-my-Default-Browser-)

### Communication

#### Slack

Slack is our main communication hub, where you and your class will talk with each other using text and video chat. You have access to all the instructions and other students, and a lot of chat rooms where different content is shared.

Install the Slack desktop app. Using the desktop app allows you to make video calls to instructors and other students, which can be handy when you want a 1:1.

- [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-nz/) messaging app. Ensure you install the desktop app as this will enable you the ability to make video calls to fellow students and instructors.

### Programming tools

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime, meaning you can run JavaScript outside of a web browser. It's used extensively in web development to both build web-servers, and to run tools on your mac computer to help with web development. You can run local servers, automate annoying tasks and a bunch of other helpful things. You need to install it, as we use a lot of tools that depend on Node.js.

Visit the [Node website](https://nodejs.org/en/). Download and install Node onto your operating system.

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a text editor with developer super powers. We use it to write our code, and it provides a lot of helpful features that make our lives much easier as a developer. You will be writing all of your code into Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

We prefer you to use VS Code as your code editor, even if you are familiar with other tools.

- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the open-source code editor.
- Make sure it's installed to your Applications folder
- Customize VS-Code by installing the following extensions:
  - [ ] [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
  - [ ] [Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
  - [ ] [Live Share Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack)

### Design

- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), free software to create designs for websites and mobile apps.
