# Sign up for GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a hugely popular cloud-hosted version of Git used by millions of software teams. The majority of courseware and projects are hosted in GitHub code repositories so you will need a GitHub account to access the course materials.

To be able to access the material you will need to setup a GitHub account:

- We will be sending you your GitHub invite via your Developers institute email account.
- You can use your Developers Institute account to start with, and add your personal email at https://github.com/settings/emails if you want to add your own email address, or vice versa.
